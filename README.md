An API for the Spotify-Client, written in .NET  
Look at the example provided in the Repo

Following 3 files will be needed for all features:
+ SpotifyAPI.dll
+ Newtonsoft.Json.dll (Will be merged into SpotifyAPI.dll in the official Releases using ILMerge)
+ nircmd.dll (Used to Mute & UnMute Spotify)
